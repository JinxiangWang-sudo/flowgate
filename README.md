FlowGate is an open source vendor-neutral project to enable facility awareness in SDDC and make IT operations management and automation better on high availability, cost saving and improved sustainability, with more information on power, cooling, environment (e.g. humidity, temperature) and security.

# Why
* In enterprise data centers, IT infrastructure and facility are generally managed separately, which leads to information gaps.
* Collaboration between facility and IT infrastructure systems are limited or manual, and virtualization adds more complexity.
* More and more workloads move into off prime colos or clouds where infrastructure are managed via outsourcing, making more gaps.
* Sound IT operations management and automation decisions may not be the best choice if not consider power, cooling or environmental constrains.
